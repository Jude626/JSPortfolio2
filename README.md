# JSPortfolio3 - 3/9/21
My Updated Portfolio part 3! Added my newest project to the assignments page. Updated LinkedIn account, and added LinkedIn ref also on the assignments page. Edited public privacy, & pinned assignments to top of my main GitHub repo page!

# JSPortfolio2
My Updated Portfolio! Created a new assignments tab to showcase 1 Project & 2 Homework Assignments. Resized images from My First Portfolio to clean up warped appearance, & used the newly learned Semantic UI styling instead of Bootstrap!
